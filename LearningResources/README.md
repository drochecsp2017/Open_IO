## Learning Resources

Open IO was undertaken by students who knew not what they were doing. 
Each of the original contributors has had to learn the technologies used
by Open IO as well as real-time multiplayer game design.

Those curious about Open IO who find themselves in the same position may
benefit from our efforts by exploring the folders contained within this
directory. In them we have placed code from some of our completed tutorials 
that help demonstrate the use of Node.js, Express, Javasript, HTML5 Canvas,
and React.

Follow the links contained the the code to the original tutorials for more
information on how it works.
