This is a very basic pong game. It is written in javascript
using the HTML5 Canvas element

This is only a single player game which exists to demonstrate
the use drawing on a canvas with javascript as well as the basic
Update/Draw steps of a game loop

To Run this code, simply open it in a browser with javascript enabled-->
